# React + Vite

This is a typing test created with React and Vite. Random phrases appear above the interactive keyboard that must be typed before moving on to the next phrase. The letter that needs to be typed next will be underlined in the phrase and the key on the virtual keyboard will be highlighted in red. Once a letter is typed, it will be blacked out in the phrase, and the next letter to type will be underlined and highlighted on the virtual keyboard.
